This project is part of the 42 cursus commun core. (GET_NEXT_LINE)
NOTICE : if you're also working on this project please check if the subject is the same as this one to avoid any problemes.
        even if your not a 42 student you can do these project to undrestand new concepts.
        and happy coding (iel-bakk).
I'll start talking about what get next line would add to your knowledge see, the get next line project aims to teach you :
first : how to read from a file using a file descriptor.
second : what are static variables.
third : how to avoid leaks.

These are what i think the things that you will need to know in order to get this project done.
The emplementation of these tools (the three thing i mentioned above) in your code will be the judge of your codes quality.

As i said before the goal of this project is to be able to read a file line by line with the '\n' included in each line.
So as a first step we need to get our hands on The file descriptor wich will be our key to access the file in order to read from it, this file discreptor is something that we get by calling the system call (OPEN).
After getting our file descriptor with the reading permission we can read form our file, but while reading ther are some rules that we must not break and these rules are :
        YOU CAN READ ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF BYTES EACH TIME YOU CALL READ.
        THE NUMBER OF BYTES YOUR ALLOWED TO READ IS DEFIEND BY THE USER (BUFFER_SIZE).
        EACH TIME YOU CALL YOUR GET NEXT LINE FUNCTION YOU MUST RETURN A SIGNLE LINE WITH THE NEW LINE INCLUDED.
        CALLING YOUR GET NEXT LINE FUNCTION IN A LOOP SHOULD PRINT THE WHOLE FILE CONTENT.
        UR CODE MUST NOT HAVE ANY LEAKS.
these are the rules concerning the output of our function (mandatory part ofcours).
