In this text file i'll be talking about the code of my "get next line" so read carefully.

It would be better if you first read the algo.txt before reading this one, to get a full undrestanding of what i'm about to dive into.

So first of all, our goal is to read from a file, for that we need to get the file descriptor, this is something you will find in how_to_main.txt.
After getting our file descripter we should check if it's a valid one or not, if it isn't valid we return null and our program will quit.
If our file descriptor is a valid one we will send it to our "miread" function, this functions role is to give us a string that contains a '\n' new line.
The string we will be getting from miread will be :

1 : a string with no new line, in this case the file we are reading from only contains a long text with no new lines.
2 : a string with new line, in this case there are 3 possible values :
			#2-1 : the string contains the new line in the middle of it's char's, this means that we will be having a "reminder" (we will be talking a bout this afterwards).
			#2-2 : the string contains a new line (\n) at the end.
			#2-3 : the string contains only a new line.
3 : (NULL), in this case we either had a problem during the execution or we reached the end of the file.

When we have a reminder in our hands we keep it in our static variable (you need to search a bit heheee) so we can use it when call get_next_line again.
This remainder will be either :
1 : NULL, if we reach the end of file, or we faced a probleme during the execution.
2 : a string that may or may not have a new line :
			#2-1 : if our remainder contains a new line this means that we won't be reading, but rather filltering our remainder to extract the line we still have inn our reminder.
			#2-2 : if our reminder dosen't contain a new line, we will be reading and joining what we read with our remainder to check for the possibility of having a new line.

I've been talking about the filltering process for a while,you should be curious how we will be filltering (heheeee this is where the fun beggins).
To fillter we will always be having two values wich are as you probsbly guessed "line" and "reminder", to get this values i struggeled a lot to keep them and also the check if they were valid or not, so with on of my peers (yel-mrab) we used a structure called s_data (you will find it in the .h file (header)), so this structure we'll be holding for us the values of the line ,the reminder and the fail_checker.
This struct contains 3 variables, two char pointers that will be having the address's of the allocated memory generated by our fillter and miread functions and also an int that we be taking two values (1 or 0) if the value is 1 this means the program should exit, if the value is 0 we will continue the process.

Last but not leat, we will be talking about leaks, to avoid leaks we will be using two functions the mifree_data and the free.
Mefree_data function was made to free the struct's content (the heap addresses holded by the two pointers) when a problem occurs and set the fail to 1.
Mifree function was made to free two strings at once, to use less lines (XD).

And this is what are code is all about, hope you learned something ^^.
